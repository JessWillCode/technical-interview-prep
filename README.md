# 🧩 Technical Interview Prep

Welcome to my **Technical Interview Prep** repository!  
This is a collection of notes, coding exercises, and resources I’m using to prepare for software engineering interviews.  
It includes implementations of **data structures, algorithms, problem solutions, and study notes**.

---

## 📌 Contents
- **📂 problems/** – Solutions to common interview questions (LeetCode, etc.)
- **📂 data-structures/** – Implementations of linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, heaps, etc.
- **📂 algorithms/** – Sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, recursion, backtracking, etc.
- **📂 system-design/** – Notes and diagrams for system design concepts.
- **📂 notes/** – Study notes, tips, and resources.
