# 🧩 Technical Interview Prep

Welcome to my **Technical Interview Prep** repository!  
This is a collection of notes, coding exercises, and resources I’m using to prepare for software engineering interviews.  
It includes implementations of **data structures, algorithms, problem solutions, and study notes**.

---

## 📌 Contents
- **📂 problems/** – Solutions to common interview questions (LeetCode, etc.)
- **📂 data-structures/** – Implementations of linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, heaps, etc.
- **📂 algorithms/** – Sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, recursion, backtracking, etc.
- **📂 system-design/** – Notes and diagrams for system design concepts.
- **📂 notes/** – Study notes, tips, and resources.

## 🚀 Goals
- [ ] Strengthen problem-solving skills in **TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python**
- [ ] Master **data structures & algorithms** for technical interviews
- [ ] Practice **system design** for senior-level interviews
- [ ] Track progress and reflect on growth
- [ ] Stay consistent: solve around **10 problems per week**

## ✅ How I Use This Repo
1. Pick a topic (e.g., linked lists, recursion, DP).
2. Solve problems related to it.
3. Document the solution with explanations and edge cases.
4. Review regularly to reinforce learning.
